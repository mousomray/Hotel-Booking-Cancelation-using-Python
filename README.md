# Insights 

* Resort hotels and city hotels combined 62.86% clients did not cancel their reservations and 37% clients canceled their reservations. This 37% cancellation significantly affects on hotel earnings. 

* The reservation rate of city hotels is higher than the reservation rate of resort hotels. So it can be said that the demand of city hotels is more than resort hotels. The main reason for this is that resort hotels are more expensive than city hotels.

* City hotel rates are lower on certain days or holidays and even lower on other days. But resort hotel rates go up on holidays or weekends and are higher than city hotels on other days too. 


* Month of August has the highest number of reservations as well as cancellation of large amount reservations. Again, the number of cancellations in the month of January is the highest.

* Hotel cancellations were highest when hotel prices were high and cancellation rates were low when prices were low. This implies that, there is a significant relationship between hotel price and hotel cancellation.

* Portugal has the highest number of cancellations among all countries. 

* Around 47% of the clients come from online travel agencies. whereas 16% come from groups. Only 10% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making  reservations.

* Reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than what it would have been without cancellations. From all the above analysis it is clear that higher prices lead to higher cancellations.
